 ##  📧 Email Verification System (Resend Integration)
Current Status: Testing/Development Mode 🧪
Why can't everyone sign up?
For security and cost-management, this project uses the Resend email service in Onboarding Mode. This means:
Restricted Domain: Currently, emails can only be sent to the developer's registered email address.
403 Forbidden Error: If you attempt to sign up with a random email, the server will return a 403 status because the domain is not yet verified in a production environment.
How to test the Signup flow?
If you are a recruiter or developer looking to test this feature, please follow these steps:
Contact me to add your email to the Authorized Test Audience.
Or, use the provided Demo Credentials below to explore the app without signing up.
## 💡 Notes

- All products, categories, and subcategories are stored in **MongoDB**.  
- Images, descriptions, prices, and variants are fetched dynamically via **Node.js + Express API**.  
- The website is **fully responsive**, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
